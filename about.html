<h1>About CoinLogix</h1>

<p>CoinLogix was built with one goal in mind: to make coin collecting easier, not harder.</p>

<p>Like a lot of collectors, I got tired of complicated, bloated, overpriced software that seemed designed more for IT departments than actual hobbyists. And did I mention overpriced?</p>

<p>I didn’t need a NASA dashboard — I needed a simple, reliable way to track my collection, add photos, print labels, and have everything in one place — without needing a computer science degree (or a second mortgage).</p>

<p>And… I wanted it to work OFFLINE. Why on earth would I take a chance on letting the rest of the world know what’s in my collection? No way, Jose… not with things the way they are these days.</p>

<p>So I decided to build my own system. I started out with another “big name” database program, wasted a lot of time and energy, and ended up back at square one. Then I found something that actually worked – that let me design things the way I wanted.</p>

<p>CoinLogix is the result: a clean, affordable, common-sense solution for real collectors.</p>

<p>CoinLogix doesn’t require you to sign away your privacy, upload your collection to the cloud, or sit through a two-hour training course just to figure out where the "Add New Coin" button is.</p>

<p>It’s built to be easy to learn, fast to use, and powerful enough to handle serious collections — all while keeping your data where it belongs: on your computer, under your control.</p>

<p>Just like any independent developer, I didn’t start out with the idea of making a commercial product. Necessity truly is the mother of invention. I built CoinLogix because I needed a solution. Then, I thought: “I’ll bet other people would like this app too.” No big company, no rooms filled with cubicles and techno-wizards. Just me and a friend – working our tails off to get it right.</p>

    <h1>About CoinLogix</h1>

    <p>CoinLogix was built with one goal in mind: <strong>to make coin collecting easier, not harder.</strong></p>

    <p>Like a lot of collectors, I got tired of complicated, bloated, overpriced software that seemed designed more for IT departments than actual hobbyists.  
    And did I mention overpriced?</p>

    <p>I didn’t need a NASA dashboard — I needed a simple, reliable way to track my collection, add photos, print labels, and have everything in one place — without needing a computer science degree (or a second mortgage).</p>

    <p>And... I wanted it to work <strong>offline</strong>.  
    Why on earth would I take a chance on letting the rest of the world know what’s in my collection?  
    <em>No way, Jose... not with things the way they are these days.</em></p>

    <p>So I decided to build my own system.  
    I started out with another “big name” database program, wasted a lot of time and energy, and ended up back at square one.  
    Then I found something that actually worked — something that let me design things the way I wanted.</p>

    <p><strong>CoinLogix is the result: a clean, affordable, common-sense solution for real collectors.</strong></p>

    <p>CoinLogix doesn’t require you to sign away your privacy, upload your collection to the cloud, or sit through a two-hour training course just to figure out where the "Add New Coin" button is.  
    It’s built to be <strong>easy to learn</strong>, <strong>fast to use</strong>, and <strong>powerful enough</strong> to handle serious collections — all while keeping your data where it belongs: <strong>on your computer, under your control.</strong></p>

    <p>Just like any independent developer, I didn’t start out with the idea of making a commercial product.  
    <strong>Necessity truly is the mother of invention.</strong>  
    I built CoinLogix because I needed a solution.  
    Then, I thought: <em>“I’ll bet other people would like this app too.”</em>  
    No big company. No rooms filled with cubicles and techno-wizards.  
    <strong>Just me and a friend — working our tails off to get it right.</strong></p>

    <p><em>CoinLogix: Built by collectors, for collectors — without all the corporate nonsense.</em></p>

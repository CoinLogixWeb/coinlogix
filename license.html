  <h1>License Agreement</h1>

  <p>Welcome to CoinLogix!</p>

  <p>You didn’t get here by accident — you’re a collector who values simplicity, privacy, transparency and common sense.
  That’s exactly how this license works, too: simple, private, transparent, and based on common sense.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>One license = one user.</strong><br>
    You bought it, you use it. No sharing it around like a fruitcake (or something else you would share) at Christmas. (Lip balm, maybe?)</li>

    <li><strong>No pirating, hacking, cracking, or reverse-engineering.</strong><br>
    You wouldn't want someone stealing your coin collection — don’t steal the code that tracks it. Seriously.</li>

    <li><strong>No re-selling or "loaning" CoinLogix out.</strong><br>
    If your friends want it, tell them to buy their own copy like a grown-up. Besides, your activation code only works once. (Although loaning it out might make for a good laugh when they figure out they can’t re-activate it!)</li>

    <li><strong>Offline software = your responsibility.</strong><br>
    You’re in charge of backing up your own data. I don’t have access to your files, can’t see your collection, and wouldn’t want to even if I could.</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Friendly Warning:</strong><br>
    If you try to pirate this software, I’ll punch your momma so hard she’ll have to pick up her mail in another zip code.<br>
    (That’s not a threat. That’s a courtesy notice.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Thanks for playing fair.<br>
  When you support independent builders instead of bloated corporations, you keep the hobby — and small business — alive. (And no tariffs! How much more fair could it be?)</p>
